# Project-10
 I've used React to create a client for an existing school database REST API that I previously created.  This full stack application will provide users a database containing information about courses.  Users can get a list of courses, view course detail, create a course , update and delete them in the database.  Users will be required to sign in and out.

To start the app on a webserver you have to run npm start in the terminal/gitbash on the api as well as the client as they are dependent upon each other to run successfully.
